 ----------------------------------------------------
 ====================== USAGE =======================

      The TLELib is  the set of C++-source files, and
 it is assumed, that  it will  be used  as the set of
 source files only. However you may build  the object
 file and link it to your project.

      In the 'samples' directory you can find several
 example, demonstrating how to use the TLELib library.
 You can see also the 'samples/Makefile', demonstrat-
 ing how one can build a project with TLELib library.

      For unit-testing the  Google C++ Testing Frame-
 work (a.k.a  GoogleTest)  is  used.  So  you  should
 install this frwmework to be able to build the unit-
 testing  program.  Make sure  also, that you defined
 the 'GTEST_DIR' environment variable in your system.
 When the GoogleTest is instaled, built and the envi-
 ronment variable is set, you can  build the  testing
 program by this command in the TLELib directory:

     make build-test

 You can find more details about the GoogleTest here:
