 ----------------------------------------------------
 ====================== USAGE =======================

      The TLELib is  the set of C++-source files, and
 it is assumed, that  it will  be used  as the set of
 source files only. However you may build  the object
 file and link it to your project.

      In the 'samples' directory you can find several
 examples,   demonstrating  how  to  use  the  TLELib
 library.  You can  see  also the 'samples/Makefile',
 demonstrating  how  one  can  build  a  project with
 TLELib library.

      For unit-testing the  Google C++ Testing Frame-
 work (a.k.a  GoogleTest)  is  used.  So  you  should
 install this framework to be able to build the unit-
 testing  program.  Make sure  also, that you defined
 the 'GTEST_DIR' environment variable in your system.
 When  GoogleTest is  installed,  built and the envi-
 ronment variable is set, you can  build the  testing
 program by this command in the TLELib directory:

     make build-test

 You can find more details about the GoogleTest here:
